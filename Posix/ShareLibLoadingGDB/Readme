Build the Program with

make clean

We can tell that our new image is dependent upon our shared library by using the ldd command. The ldd command prints shared library dependencies for the given application. For example:

$ ldd test
    libmyrand.so => not found
    libc.so.6 => /lib/tls/libc.so.6 (0x42000000)
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
$
The ldd command identifies the shared libraries that will be used by test. The standard C library is shown (libc.so.6) as is the dynamic linker/loader (ld-linux.so.2). Note that our libmyrand.so file is shown as not found. It.s present in the current subdirectory with our application, but it must be explicitly specified to GNU/Linux. We do this through the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. After exporting the location of our shared library, we try our ldd command again:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./
$ ldd test
        libmyrand.so => ./libmyrand.so (0x40017000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/tls/libc.so.6 (0x42000000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
$
We specify that our shared libraries are found in the current directory (./), and then after performing another ldd, our shared library is successfully found.
